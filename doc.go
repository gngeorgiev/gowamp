// Package gowamp implements WAMPv2 - The Web Application Messaging Protocol.
//
// It provides router and client library implementations as well as a basic
// stand-alone router. The router library can be used to embed a WAMP router in
// another application, or to build a custom router implementation. The client
// library can be used to communicate with any WAMP router.
//
// See the official WAMP documentation at http://wamp.ws for more details on the
// protocol.
